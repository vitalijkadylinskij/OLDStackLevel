    first-section-title: "Why we use React"
    first-section-text:
      "The great thing about React is that it can be implemented gradually
      (if you want to). Some JS frameworks require you to make a big investment
      in their infrastructure in order to start getting any usable results, but
      React allows you to start replacing components of your web app piece-by-piece.
      It is highly effective for teams because it encourages the reuse of UI patterns
      and requires a readable syntax."
    first-block-body:
      "We prefer to use React and Redux when we’re building a full client side
      application as opposed to a website with some rich interactions."
    second-block-body:
      "Redux is a Flux Library we use to maintain state when using React. Using Redux you
      define actions which you use to modify your state. This prevents bugs that were common
      when using plain ReactJS."
    third-block-body:
      "React Native gives our team the chance to write fast, native applications on Android and
      iOS in a single codebase while sharing large amounts of logic. This means we can ship faster
      to both platforms."
    second-section-title: "Why we сhoose React.js:"

    first-section-title: "Why we love Rails"
    first-block-title: "Batteries included"
    first-block-body:
      "Rails was the first non-enterprise, opinionated, and complete
      Web framework. It had built-in pluralization of nouns! There are database
      migrations, distinct runtime environments and many more fascinating tools!
      A huge bag of helpful methods, which abstract common tasks and help code
      to read beautifully. It takes mere minutes to spin up a server and deploy
      to Heroku, for free!"
    second-block-title: "Active development"
    second-block-body: "We use Rails because it solves its specific problem
      more efficiently, thanks to the years of development over other systems.
      Django is the closest competitor, but it has historically lacked
      the people-power that the Rails ecosystem had. For secure, stable and
      simple CRUD: Rails. For most of the Web: Rails."
    third-block-title: "A wonderful community"
    third-block-body:
      "Once we got into Rails it became clear that there was a great
      open source community around Ruby and Rails which made doing new or even
      scary things a lot simpler."
    fourth-block-title: "When Rails isn't a good choice"
    fourth-block-body:
      "Go or Elixir/Phoenix make more sense for The non-web internet:
      chat, email, SSH, Redis sockets, command-line API tools, custom
      network servers, anything synchronous. Anything that scales
      vertically, or has a significant amount of traffic (>10kRPM),
      should probably not be done in Rails."

      item-2: "Huge collection of ready open source solutions"

  # nodejs page
  nodejs:
    subtitle: "Choosing a programming platform depends on several
      aspects including speed, learning curve, scalability, ease of coding, community and professional support and several other factors.
      In all these parameters Node.js come as the champion among the server side languages and no wonder that startups will show convincing preference to it."

          extremely fast engine! If your application does a lot of reading and writing
          to the internet or the filesystem, Nodejs is the most expedient technology out
          there that can be used to build your application"
        second-title: "Highly Scalable"
        second-body:
          "Node.js works on a principle called the event loop, which is unlike other tradition
          web application frameworks; something that makes it all more scalable
          for real-time apps. Scale is not something you will worry about when choosing to use Node.js"
        third-title: "Real Time"
        third-body:
          "Node.js excels in real time applications because of WebSockets. WebSockets
          are open 2-way communication channels between the client and the server.
          And this makes it really easy to build realtime applications like Games,
          Chat Engines, etc"

          to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails,

          APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture."

          which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation
